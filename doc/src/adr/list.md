## Overview

These Architecture Decision Records document the key design choices made in the Fork Management Template project. Each ADR explains the context, decision, rationale, and consequences of significant architectural choices that enable automated management of long-lived forks of upstream repositories.

## Quick Reference

### Core Architecture Decisions

**Three-Branch Strategy (ADR-001)**
- `main`: Stable production branch
- `fork_upstream`: Tracks upstream changes
- `fork_integration`: Conflict resolution workspace

**Automation Framework (ADR-002)**
- GitHub Actions for all workflow automation (init, sync, cascade, validate, build, release)
- Issue lifecycle tracking and duplicate prevention for upstream sync
- Modular workflow design with separation of concerns

**Two-Workflow Initialization (ADR-006)**
- Separated user interaction from repository setup
- Issue-driven configuration with progress updates
- Simplified state management and error handling

**Workflow Bootstrap Pattern (ADR-007)**
- Self-updating initialization workflows
- Ensures latest fixes are always available
- Solves the template version bootstrap problem

**Centralized Label Management (ADR-008)**
- All labels defined in `.github/labels.json`
- Created during repository initialization
- Single source of truth for label definitions

**Version Management (ADR-004)**
- Release Please with Conventional Commits
- Automated semantic versioning
- Upstream version reference tracking

**Configuration-Driven Template Sync (ADR-011)**
- `.github/sync-config.json` defines what files get synced
- Selective synchronization between template and forked repositories
- Automated cleanup of template-specific content

**Template Update Propagation (ADR-012)**
- Weekly automated template updates via `template-sync.yml`
- AI-enhanced PR descriptions and human-centric manual cascade instructions
- Solves template drift problem for forked repositories

**Reusable GitHub Actions (ADR-013)**
- Custom composite action for AI-enhanced PR creation
- DRY principle for common workflow functionality
- Centralized AI integration with multiple provider support

**AI-Enhanced Workflows (ADR-014)**
- Multi-provider AI support (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI)
- AI-powered security analysis and PR description generation

**Template-Workflows Separation (ADR-015)**
- Clean separation between template development and fork production workflows
- `.github/workflows/` for template development (not copied)
- `.github/template-workflows/` for fork production workflows (copied during init)
- Eliminates workflow pollution in fork repositories

**Initialization Security Handling (ADR-016)**
- Temporarily disables push protection during initialization
- Allows syncing upstream repositories with historical secrets
- Re-enables full security immediately after initialization
- Simple and maintainable approach without complex error handling

**MCP Server Integration Pattern (ADR-017)**
- Automatic MCP server configuration for GitHub Copilot Agent
- Maven MCP Server provides AI-enhanced dependency management
- Configuration stored in fork-resources for template-wide deployment
- Read-only MCP servers for security and Maven Central integration

**Fork-Resources Staging Pattern (ADR-018)**
- `.github/fork-resources/` as staging area for specialized template deployment
- Templates requiring custom deployment logic (issue templates, AI configs, prompts)
- Two-stage deployment: template staging → fork final locations
- Integrates with sync configuration for automatic updates

**Cascade Monitor Pattern (ADR-019)**
- Human-centric cascade: manual triggering as primary path, monitor as safety net
- Issue lifecycle tracking with label-based state management
- Health monitoring detects missed triggers and conflict escalation
- Explicit human control over integration timing with clear instructions

**Human-Required Label Strategy (ADR-020)**
- Label-based task management replaces unreliable assignee approach
- `human-required` label marks items needing attention without username resolution
- Team-flexible filtering and priority systems via label combinations
- Works across all repository instances without GraphQL API failures

**Pull Request Target Trigger Pattern (ADR-021)**
- Solves "missing YAML" problem for cascade triggering
- Uses `pull_request_target` to read workflow from main branch
- Single-line change for dramatic reliability improvement
- Maintains same security model as PAT approach

**Issue Lifecycle Tracking Pattern (ADR-022)**
- Comprehensive tracking of cascade state through GitHub issues
- Label-based state management for machine and human readability
- Complete audit trail from upstream sync to production deployment
- Integration with human-centric cascade pattern

**Meta Commit Strategy for Release Please (ADR-023)**
- Preserves complete upstream commit history while enabling automated versioning
- AIPR analyzes commit ranges to generate conventional meta commits
- Fallback to conservative `feat:` commits when AI unavailable
- Solves conflict between upstream non-conventional commits and Release Please requirements

**Sync Workflow Duplicate Prevention Architecture (ADR-024)**
- State-based duplicate detection using git config persistence
- Smart decision matrix for handling all duplicate sync scenarios
- Branch update strategy maintains human workflow continuity
- Automatic cleanup of abandoned sync branches and state management

**Java/Maven Build Architecture (ADR-025)**
- Java 17 Temurin as standard runtime with Maven 3.9+ build tool
- JaCoCo coverage reporting and GitLab Maven repository integration
- Reusable GitHub Actions for consistent build implementation
- Zero-configuration support for standard OSDU Java projects

**Dependabot Security Update Strategy (ADR-026)**
- Security-first configuration with 48-hour patch SLA
- Grouped dependency updates to reduce PR noise
- Conservative update policy for stability
- Automated validation and auto-merge for safe updates

**Documentation Generation with MkDocs (ADR-027)**
- MkDocs Material theme for professional documentation site
- Automatic publishing to GitHub Pages
- Full-text search and mobile-responsive design
- ADRs automatically included in documentation

**Workflow Script Extraction Pattern (ADR-028)**
- Extract embedded bash scripts to `.github/actions/` for local testing
- Composite action wrappers enable parameter passing and reuse
- Leverages existing sync infrastructure for propagation to forks
- 40% reduction in workflow file sizes with eliminated duplication

**GitHub App Authentication Strategy (ADR-029)**
- Replace PATs with GitHub Apps for workflow automation
- Short-lived tokens (1 hour) vs long-lived PATs (90+ days)
- Microsoft-compliant authentication eliminating PAT dependency
- Centralized management not tied to individual employees
- Required for release automation and repository initialization under org security policies
