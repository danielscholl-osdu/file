# ADR-030: CodeQL Summary Job Pattern for Required Status Checks

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-10-29

## Context

Fork repositories experienced PR blocking issues when using the CodeQL workflow with GitHub repository rulesets. Two related problems emerged:

### Problem 1: Required Status Check Mismatch

Repository rulesets configured during initialization require a status check named `"CodeQL"`:

```json
{
  "type": "required_status_checks",
  "parameters": {
    "required_status_checks": [
      {"context": "CodeQL"}
    ]
  }
}
```

However, the CodeQL workflow provided different job names:
- `"Check if Code Changes Present"` (always runs)
- `"Detect Project Languages"` (conditional)
- `"Analyze Code"` (conditional)

When PRs contained only configuration changes (e.g., dependabot.yml, workflows), the CodeQL workflow correctly skipped analysis to save resources. However, no check named `"CodeQL"` ever reported, leaving PRs in a **BLOCKED** state indefinitely.

### Problem 2: Code Scanning Rule Blocking Config-Only PRs

The default branch protection ruleset included a `code_scanning` rule:

```json
{
  "type": "code_scanning",
  "parameters": {
    "code_scanning_tools": [{
      "tool": "CodeQL",
      "security_alerts_threshold": "high_or_higher",
      "alerts_threshold": "errors"
    }]
  }
}
```

This rule **requires** CodeQL to upload SARIF results (security scan analysis). For config-only PRs where analysis is appropriately skipped, no SARIF is uploaded, permanently blocking the PR. Even admin override (`gh pr merge --admin`) failed with:

```
Code scanning is waiting for results from CodeQL for the commits...
```

### Impact

- **Template sync PRs blocked**: Config-only changes (dependabot, workflow updates) couldn't merge
- **Dependabot PRs blocked**: Dependency updates for `.github/` files couldn't merge
- **Manual intervention required**: Every config-only PR needed manual ruleset modification
- **Inconsistent security posture**: Some forks removed the rule manually, creating inconsistency

## Decision

Implement a two-part solution:

### 1. Add CodeQL Summary Job

Add a summary job to the CodeQL workflow that:
- **Named `"CodeQL"`**: Matches the required status check context exactly
- **Always executes**: Uses `if: always()` to run regardless of previous job outcomes
- **Smart validation**: Reports success for config-only changes, validates analysis results for code changes
- **Proper failure handling**: Fails if actual analysis fails or is cancelled

```yaml
CodeQL:
  name: CodeQL  # Job name becomes the check context
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [check-paths, detect-languages, analyze]
  if: always()  # Executes even when analysis skips
  steps:
    - name: Report CodeQL Status
      run: |
        # Validate check-paths succeeded
        if [ "${{ needs.check-paths.result }}" != "success" ]; then
          exit 1
        fi

        # Config-only changes: Report success
        if [ "${{ needs.check-paths.outputs.should-run }}" = "false" ]; then
          echo "✅ CodeQL skipped - only configuration files changed"
          exit 0
        fi

        # Code changes: Validate analysis completed
        if [ "${{ needs.analyze.result }}" = "failure" ] ||
           [ "${{ needs.analyze.result }}" = "cancelled" ]; then
          exit 1
        fi

        echo "✅ CodeQL checks completed successfully"
```

### 2. Remove Code Scanning Rule from Template

Remove the `code_scanning` rule from `.github/rulesets/default-branch.json`:

**Rationale**:
- The rule requires SARIF upload for every PR
- Config-only PRs appropriately skip analysis (no code to scan)
- No SARIF uploaded → PR permanently blocked
- Status checks provide sufficient validation
- CodeQL still runs on code changes and reports findings

## Rationale

### Why Summary Job Pattern

1. **Workflow Composability**: GitHub Actions doesn't support renaming jobs dynamically
2. **Single Source of Truth**: One job consolidates the status of multiple conditional jobs
3. **Standard Pattern**: Widely used in GitHub Actions for exactly this use case
4. **Flexibility**: Can add more checks in the future without changing ruleset

### Why Remove Code Scanning Rule

1. **SARIF Upload Requirement**: The rule fundamentally requires results upload
2. **No Conditional SARIF**: Can't conditionally satisfy the rule (it either has results or doesn't)
3. **Analysis Already Validated**: The status check validates that analysis ran when needed
4. **Security Findings Still Visible**: Results still appear in Security tab when analysis runs
5. **Most Teams Prefer Triage**: Blocking on alert thresholds is often too strict; teams prefer to triage findings

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Always Upload Empty SARIF for Skipped Analysis

**Approach**: Generate and upload a minimal valid SARIF file when analysis is skipped

```yaml
- name: Upload empty SARIF for skipped analysis
  if: needs.check-paths.outputs.should-run == 'false'
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v4
  with:
    sarif_file: empty.sarif
```

**Pros**:
- Satisfies the `code_scanning` rule
- Maintains alert threshold blocking capability

**Cons**:
- ❌ Adds complexity and maintenance burden
- ❌ Generates misleading data (empty scan results)
- ❌ Violates principle of least surprise
- ❌ No real security benefit over status checks

**Decision**: Rejected due to complexity without meaningful security benefit

### 2. Rename Existing Jobs to "CodeQL"

**Approach**: Change `check-paths` job name to "CodeQL"

**Pros**:
- Simple, no new jobs

**Cons**:
- ❌ Loses semantic meaning ("CodeQL" doesn't describe what check-paths does)
- ❌ Doesn't solve code_scanning rule problem
- ❌ Confusing when check-paths succeeds but analysis never ran

**Decision**: Rejected due to loss of clarity

### 3. Use Workflow-Level Required Checks Only

**Approach**: Remove job-level requirements, require entire workflow success

**Pros**:
- Simpler configuration

**Cons**:
- ❌ GitHub rulesets don't support workflow-level checks (only job names)
- ❌ Not technically feasible with current GitHub features

**Decision**: Rejected as not possible

### 4. Keep Code Scanning Rule, Block Config PRs

**Approach**: Accept that config-only PRs will block and require manual override

**Pros**:
- Maintains strict security enforcement

**Cons**:
- ❌ Terrible user experience for legitimate PRs
- ❌ Breaks automation (Dependabot, template sync)
- ❌ Manual intervention doesn't scale
- ❌ Security theater (config files don't need CodeQL)

**Decision**: Rejected due to operational impact

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Config-only PRs work**: Dependabot, template sync, and workflow updates merge without blocking
✅ **Security scanning preserved**: CodeQL still runs on code changes
✅ **Findings visible**: Results still appear in Security tab
✅ **Better automation**: Template sync works reliably
✅ **Consistent behavior**: All forks behave identically
✅ **Clear semantics**: "CodeQL" check clearly represents CodeQL validation status

### Negative

❌ **Lost alert threshold blocking**: Can't require "zero high-severity alerts" before merge
❌ **Manual security triage**: Teams must review findings rather than being blocked
❌ **Existing forks need update**: Forks created before this change need manual ruleset modification

### Mitigations

- Security findings still generate notifications and appear in Security tab
- Teams can still review findings before merge (just not forced to)
- Most organizations prefer manual triage over strict blocking (false positives common)
- The summary job can be enhanced later to check alert severity if needed

## Implementation

### Files Changed

1. **`.github/template-workflows/codeql.yml`**
   - Added `CodeQL` summary job
   - Validates previous jobs and reports consolidated status

2. **`.github/rulesets/default-branch.json`**
   - Removed `code_scanning` rule
   - Kept `required_status_checks` with "CodeQL" context

### Migration Path for Existing Forks

Forks created before this change may have the `code_scanning` rule in their rulesets. To fix:

1. Navigate to: Settings → Rules → Rulesets → "Default Branch Protection"
2. Edit the ruleset
3. Remove the "Code scanning" rule
4. Save changes

Or via API:
```bash
gh api --method PUT repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets/RULESET_ID \
  --input updated-ruleset.json
```

Next template sync will provide the updated CodeQL workflow automatically.

## Related Decisions

- **ADR-010**: YAML-safe shell scripting pattern (used in summary job)
- **ADR-028**: Workflow script extraction pattern (influenced job structure)
- **Product Spec**: CodeQL workflow specification (dynamic path filtering)

## Success Criteria

✅ Config-only PRs merge without manual intervention
✅ Code changes still trigger CodeQL analysis
✅ Security findings appear in Security tab
✅ Status check "CodeQL" reports correctly for both scenarios
✅ Existing forks can apply fix with documented migration path
